# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning in Python
This project demonstrates a simple example of predicting sales using machine learning techniques in Python.
The example uses a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
## Project Structure
- `salesprediction(1).py`: The main Python script containing the sales prediction workflow.
- `advertising.csv`: The dataset containing historical sales data and advertising expenditures.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
## Dataset
The dataset (`advertising.csv`) should have the following columns:
- `TV`: Advertising expenditure on TV.
- `Radio`: Advertising expenditure on Radio.
- `Newspaper`: Advertising expenditure on Newspaper.
- `Sales`: Historical sales figures.
## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
